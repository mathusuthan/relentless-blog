<br/>Welcome ...I am a ML Engineer and I try to learn and do stuff. Namely Algorithms, Mathematics, Visualization, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I wanted to maintain a record of things I am learning so it is useful to me and hopefully others. Hence this blog.

Enjoy it and share from it. Let me know of any interesting stuff you do. 

Above all, stay safe and stay happy.
